Player Characters may belong to any guild (no renown) or be guild-less. All Player Characters are fresh recruits to the newly formed Ravnica Expedition Corp (no renown). While this story is set on Ravnica players are not allowed to play as a planeswalker. The reason for this is simple planeswalkers are really hard to balance D&amp;D around. If you want to play a planeswalker may I introduce you to a sister game of D&amp;D called Magic the Gathering where the tagline for over a decade has been \"You are a Planeswalker!\" If you are dead set on playing as one talk to the DM to home-brew a transformation. <br>Player Characters may be of any race and class in the <a data-href=\"Approved Material\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Approved Material</a> if you wish to play something outside of that seek DM approval. This is one of the most high fantasy campaigns imaginable. Your race will probably be approved, classes from other sources including home-brew are probably fine but the DM reserves the right to re-balance with the player as needed. This campaign uses a modified set of rules for Character creation: Origin feats may be replaced with any feat that the character meets the requirements for IF AND ONLY IF the character is created above level one. <br>\nEveryone is allowed a <a data-href=\"Signature Magical Item\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Signature Magical Item</a>. Starting magical items are restricted to uncommon items that DO NOT have +1, +2, or +3 in their descriptions. If you want to select the endgame version of the magic item you want the DM will work with you to home-brew a starting version. <br>\nIf you would like to have an innate boon instead of a Signature Magical Item look over <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/charcreationoptions.html#anvilwrought_mot,fbmt:sand~b1~b0~b0,flstfeature%20type:supernatural%20gift=1,flopfeature%20type:extend\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/charcreationoptions.html#anvilwrought_mot,fbmt:sand~b1~b0~b0,flstfeature%20type:supernatural%20gift=1,flopfeature%20type:extend\" target=\"_self\">Supernatural Gifts.</a> Just like your Signature Magical Item these Gifts can evolve with you over time.

The variant rule for 4d6dl1 is easy for each die you roll you may use the dice as rolled or 3 players choice. This caps the lower bound of each stat to 9. Unless you specifically want to role play with lower stats. Players are allowed, and encouraged, to have and play multiple characters. This used to be the norm. 5e players strayed from this when a group not going to name any names cough Critical Role cough gained a lot of popularity. By the way I love Critical Role I own two of their books and think Matt Mercer and Brennan Lee Mulligan are some of the best DMs of all time ... I still think Vox Machina, Acquisitions Incorporated, and the Mighty Nein are a large component in this shift in thinking especially amongst new players. <br>If running multiple characters becomes problematic (disrupts the flow of play) the DM reserves the right to temporarily demote a secondary character to a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/classes.html#expert%20sidekick_tce,fbmt:sand~b0~b0~b0,flstsource:tce=1~erlw=1~efa=1~phb=1~scag=1~xge=1~bgg=1~xphb=1~mot=1~vrgr=1~frhof=1~dmg=1~psa=1~ggr=1~egw=1~ftd=1~uathemysticclass=1~psk=1~dsotdq=1~lordtob=1~humblewoodcampaignsetting=1~grimhollowpg24=1~humblewoodtales=1~pugilist2024=1~valdagunslinger=1,flstmiscellaneous:sidekick=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/classes.html#expert%20sidekick_tce,fbmt:sand~b0~b0~b0,flstsource:tce=1~erlw=1~efa=1~phb=1~scag=1~xge=1~bgg=1~xphb=1~mot=1~vrgr=1~frhof=1~dmg=1~psa=1~ggr=1~egw=1~ftd=1~uathemysticclass=1~psk=1~dsotdq=1~lordtob=1~humblewoodcampaignsetting=1~grimhollowpg24=1~humblewoodtales=1~pugilist2024=1~valdagunslinger=1,flstmiscellaneous:sidekick=1\" target=\"_self\">SideKick</a> for the sake of streamlining play. If you would like to make one of your extra characters a sidekick by default that's fine.

Should the main character die and you wish to rework a \"permanent sidekick\" into a main class that will be allowed.Players can expect to have access to true resurrection magic (for a price).

Again for total creative freedom ... work with the DM to get your overpowered furry OC home-brew approved.\nRoll some mother fucking dice! Also known as Get your Ability Scores. Generate your abilities scores with any method mentioned above. Rolls must be made in front of the DM. There is a secret 4th option from older editions no one talks about any more. It's roll 1d20 per score. I'll let you choose this one if you want. But no grace rolls or taking averages. You are stuck with what you get.\nPick an Alignment. This is a stupid and outdated set of mechanics. Our first two steps replace this.\nWork with the DM to get your backstory approved. This is the most important part of making your Character come to life in the world. You know who you want to play from the first two steps. Now you work with the DM to integrate them into the larger story. After this step you should no longer be your characters biggest fan. The game is more fun when you make the DM the biggest fan of your character. When the DM roots for the party to win you get away with more dope shit at the table.\nSelect your Signature Magic Item with DM approval. Copy a bunch of shit down from the books onto your character sheet. This is the part that sucks the most but without it your character doesn't exist. It's not that bad at level one and when you level up normally you get lots of downtime to repeat this step copying down your new abilities. Get used to it now if you struggle the DM will help you but as the campaign goes on you should want to be able to do this yourself.\nHave a snack! Grab a drink! Get one of each for you DM!

If you have lived here for a while forgive me but we have a lot of newcomers these days so let me start by setting the scene. Here on Ravnica we expanded our glorious city until it covered the entire world! As you can imagine having a world spanning city means there's a lot of different ideas and peoples that all have to live together here on Ravnica. You can thank the guild pact for keeping the peace here. Once upon a time we didn't have one and the whole world was in chaos. But that was over 10,000 years ago! More recently we didn't have one again but through some magic that's a bit over my head the guild pact was restored now as a mortal man named Jace Beleren. With peace restored at least while Jace was on Ravnica the city returned to its normal state for the last 20 years or so. Then we were invaded by fucking blue alien zombie hippos pulling chariots for blue fucking alien zombies!!! The history books have taken to calling that event the war of the spark. We lost many Ravnicans during those dark days. The entire plane was a war zone, and when a Ravnican died they just got raised as a zombie to help the invaders. Eventually with the help of many Planeswalkers, who were temporarily trapped here, Niv-Mizzet awoke as the avatar of the plane, the new living guild pact, a dragon, and a god. With this newfound power the invaders were defeated. With the average Ravnican now aware that our world is simply one of many in an infinite cosmos there was a public outcry to learn more about other worlds.It's been 5 years since the war of the spark ended. And we are proud to announce that at long last the Ravnica Expedition Corp is opening general recruitment! We have been sending Ravnicans out into the multiverse since the war of the spark to recruit powerful allies and learn all about the various cultures of the other planes! But now we have perfected the very technology that was once our ruin the Planar Bridge is now the Planar Gate. Before it could only move non-living matter across planar boundaries, but now that the fire mind has had an opportunity to study it, and enough goblins have been tossed in as experiments. We can confidently say that it is a safe and effective way to travel. The Ravnica Expedition Corp is special joint venture between all the guilds under the direct control of Niv-Mizzet himself. Join us here at the Ravnica Expedition Corp and see the worlds!
