As powers that have been long separated now collide new legends are growing. Will you join their ranks? Will your story remember you as a hero or as a villain?The endgame of this campaign has fights with literal gods and players will have the option to undergo <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Demi-god Transformations\" data-href=\"Demi-god Transformations\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">demi-god transformations</a>.

Player Characters may belong to any guild (no renown) or be guild-less. All Player Characters are fresh recruits to the newly formed Ravnica Expedition Corp (no renown). While this story is set on Ravnica players are not allowed to play as a planeswalker. The reason for this is simple planeswalkers are really hard to balance D&amp;D around. If you want to play a planeswalker may I introduce you to a sister game of D&amp;D called Magic the Gathering where the tagline for over a decade has been \"You are a Planeswalker!\" If you are dead set on playing as one talk to the DM to home-brew a transformation. <br>Player Characters may be of any race and class in the <a data-href=\"Approved Material\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Approved Material</a> if you wish to play something outside of that seek DM approval. This is one of the most high fantasy campaigns imaginable. Your race will probably be approved, classes from other sources including home-brew are probably fine but the DM reserves the right to re-balance with the player as needed. This campaign uses a modified set of rules for Character creation: Origin feats may be replaced with any feat that the character meets the requirements for IF AND ONLY IF the character is created above level one. <br>\nEveryone is allowed a <a data-href=\"Signature Magical Item\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Signature Magical Item</a>. Starting magical items are restricted to uncommon items that DO NOT have +1, +2, or +3 in their descriptions. If you want to select the endgame version of the magic item you want the DM will work with you to home-brew a starting version. <br>\nIf you would like to have an innate boon instead of a Signature Magical Item look over <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/charcreationoptions.html#anvilwrought_mot,fbmt:sand~b1~b0~b0,flstfeature%20type:supernatural%20gift=1,flopfeature%20type:extend\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/charcreationoptions.html#anvilwrought_mot,fbmt:sand~b1~b0~b0,flstfeature%20type:supernatural%20gift=1,flopfeature%20type:extend\" target=\"_self\">Supernatural Gifts.</a> Just like your Signature Magical Item these Gifts can evolve with you over time. Work with the dungeon master to create what you want. <br>\nYou may use <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/statgen.html#pointbuy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/statgen.html#pointbuy\" target=\"_self\">Point Buy</a>, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/statgen.html#array\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/statgen.html#array\" target=\"_self\">Standard Array</a>, or a variant on <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://statroller.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://statroller.com/\" target=\"_self\">4d6dl1</a> for generating Ability Scores. The variant rule for 4d6dl1 is easy for each die you roll you may use the dice as rolled or 3 players choice. This caps the lower bound of each stat to 9. Unless you specifically want to role play with lower stats. Players are allowed, and encouraged, to have and play as multiple characters. This used to be very normal although it has fallen out of favor with most 5e players. For the first few sessions I will be limiting you to playing one character at a time to streamline play. After that I will open this up for you. Multiple characters allows for a lot more interesting play options at the table. Suddenly things like splitting the party aren't nearly as big of an issue. The DM can always scale the difficultly of encounters when the party splits so the real reason that parties are told to avoid it is that its boring for Players when they are off screen for an extended period, having multiple character fixes this because you just send one of your characters with each group. As a Player you also dramatically expand your options in the story. Barbarians are great super fun, definitely in the top 15 of available classes, but they can start to feel pointless when there is nothing to rage at and smash. Bard's are great in social situations and you can make them great in combat but outside of combat is where they shine. If you are playing both of them at the same time you actually get to min-max without min-maxing. Instead of focusing on how do I make this character the best I can for their mechanical role in the party, you get to relax a little and do stupid things like put all your points into strength on the barbarian because you know the bard is going to send a lot of heals your way in combat. And then out of combat you still can have more dynamic engagement with the plot than \"Grok hit tiny man?\" which you know is hysterical for at least the first 1,000 times you say it but eventually it gets overplayed. If the thought of running two full blown characters sounds like way too much to handle, I get it. It really can be a lot to think about at the table. But you can do it I know you can because the DM does it with many characters every session. If you are still intimidated remember that you are encouraged but not required to have multiple characters. <br>Also last thought on the matter <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/classes.html#expert%20sidekick_tce,fbmt:sand~b0~b0~b0,flstsource:tce=1~erlw=1~efa=1~phb=1~scag=1~xge=1~bgg=1~xphb=1~mot=1~vrgr=1~frhof=1~dmg=1~psa=1~ggr=1~egw=1~ftd=1~uathemysticclass=1~psk=1~dsotdq=1~lordtob=1~humblewoodcampaignsetting=1~grimhollowpg24=1~humblewoodtales=1~pugilist2024=1~valdagunslinger=1,flstmiscellaneous:sidekick=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/classes.html#expert%20sidekick_tce,fbmt:sand~b0~b0~b0,flstsource:tce=1~erlw=1~efa=1~phb=1~scag=1~xge=1~bgg=1~xphb=1~mot=1~vrgr=1~frhof=1~dmg=1~psa=1~ggr=1~egw=1~ftd=1~uathemysticclass=1~psk=1~dsotdq=1~lordtob=1~humblewoodcampaignsetting=1~grimhollowpg24=1~humblewoodtales=1~pugilist2024=1~valdagunslinger=1,flstmiscellaneous:sidekick=1\" target=\"_self\">SideKicks</a> exist. They are dramatically simplified characters which can make a good starting point to playing multiple characters. Some of the most fun I ever had was playing a Dark Elf Cleric with an int of 6 with a conman Aarakocra Expert Sidekick with a cha of 20 manipulating him. At least one of those characters shows up in this campaign :) Should the main character die and you wish to rework a sidekick into a main class that will be allowed.Players can expect to have access to true resurrection magic (for a price).

If you have lived here for a while forgive me but we have a lot of newcomers these days so let me start by setting the scene. Here on Ravnica we expanded our glorious city until it covered the entire world! As you can imagine having a world spanning city means there's a lot of different ideas and peoples that all have to live together here on Ravnica. You can thank the guild pact for keeping the peace here. Once upon a time we didn't have one and the whole world was in chaos. But that was over 10,000 years ago! More recently we didn't have one again but through some magic that's a bit over my head the guild pact was restored now as a mortal man named Jace Beleren. With peace restored at least while Jace was on Ravnica the city returned to its normal state for the last 20 years or so. Then we were invaded by fucking blue alien zombie hippos pulling chariots for blue fucking alien zombies!!! The history books have taken to calling that event the war of the spark. We lost many Ravnicans during those dark days. The entire plane was a war zone, and when a Ravnican died they just got raised as a zombie to help the invaders. Eventually with the help of many Planeswalkers, who were temporarily trapped here, Niv-Mizzet awoke as the avatar of the plane, the new living guild pact, a dragon, and a god. With this newfound power the invaders were defeated. With the average Ravnican now aware that our world is simply one of many in an infinite cosmos there was a public outcry to learn more about other worlds.It's been 5 years since the war of the spark ended. And we are proud to announce that at long last the Ravnica Expedition Corp is opening general recruitment! We have been sending Ravnicans out into the multiverse since the war of the spark to recruit powerful allies and learn all about the various cultures of the other planes! But now we have perfected the very technology that was once our ruin the Planar Bridge is now the Planar Gate. Before it could only move non-living matter across planar boundaries, but now that the fire mind has had an opportunity to study it, and enough goblins have been tossed in as experiments. We can confidently say that it is a safe and effective way to travel. The Ravnica Expedition Corp is special joint venture between all the guilds under the direct control of Niv-Mizzet himself. Join us here at the Ravnica Expedition Corp and see the worlds! Do you have what it takes to become one of Ravnica's best?","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["ravnica.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"setting-details.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1771443628545,"modifiedTime":1771511530152,"sourceSize":2523,"sourcePath":"Setting details.md","exportPath":"setting-details.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":16,"backlinks":["character-creation.html","index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"npcs/casper.html":{"title":"Casper","icon":"","description":"A ghost who acts as the official envoy of the Orzhov guild to the REC.

An individual can choose to belong to any guild—or no guild. Some guilds, such as Selesnya and Boros, actively recruit new members, while others simply accept those who seek membership. People within a family might join different guilds, which can lead to strong connections between the guilds in question or to painful animosity in families whose members follow different paths.Even though citizens can choose their guild associations, long-standing traditions steer certain individuals toward a particular guild. For example, it would be highly unusual for a Devkarin elf (a dark elf) to join any guild other than the Golgari, and the Ordruun line of minotaurs has provided the Boros armies with generations of offspring. Members of certain races are also drawn to specific guilds, as noted in the description of each of guild.You establish your character's membership in a guild by choosing that guild's background from among those detailed in this chapter. This book assumes that you have chosen a guild and that you maintain your association with it throughout your life. As a result, your choice of guild can play a more significant role than most backgrounds do in shaping what your character does now, not just what you accomplished in the past.<br>The backgrounds associated with guilds in this chapter work like those in the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#phb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#phb\" target=\"_self\">Player's Handbook</a>, giving you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws). Each guild entry also provides personal contacts; suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a member of a spell casting class.The spellcasters of Ravnica's guilds have a style of magic specific to their guild. A guild's description includes a list of guild spells that epitomize the type of magic the guild favors. The Boros Legion, for example, tends to prefer using spells of fire magic and holy light, and its guild spell list reflects that emphasis.If you play a character who has the Spell casting or the Pact Magic class feature, your guild spells are added to the spell list for your class, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.As a benefit of your guild membership, you have contacts both inside and outside the guild. Contacts are useful resources in the urban environment of Ravnica, where a friendly face can be more valuable than gold.<br>As stated in the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#phb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#phb\" target=\"_self\">Player's Handbook</a>, bonds represent your connections to people, places, and events in the world. Contacts are people you have a connection to, but they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in comparison, are simply people you know. They might be friends, rivals, or even family members, but their relationship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.Although the tables of contacts in this chapter describe non player characters who are members of guilds (your own and others), you are likely to acquire guild-less contacts as well. NPCs such as goblin gang leaders, minotaur bartenders, and vedalken tailors all go about their lives in the shadow of the guilds but divorced from those groups' intrigue and politics.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr,2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr,2\" target=\"_self\">Source</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Ten Guilds one City","level":1,"id":"Ten_Guilds_one_City_0"},{"heading":"Guild Membership","level":2,"id":"Guild_Membership_0"},{"heading":"Guild Spells","level":3,"id":"Guild_Spells_0"},{"heading":"Bonds and Contacts","level":3,"id":"Bonds_and_Contacts_0"}],"links":["ravnica.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"guilds/guild-primer.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1771521233623,"modifiedTime":1771521943012,"sourceSize":4457,"sourcePath":"Guilds/Guild Primer.md","exportPath":"guilds/guild-primer.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":1,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"npcs/straken.html":{"title":"Straken","icon":"","description":"A humanoid with feathers and scales.
