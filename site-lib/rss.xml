To look at her, nothing would seem out of place: her cape spilled elegantly from her officer's armor, her sword shone like a decorative piece one would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals displayed her district-spanning rank.”— Doug Beyer,&nbsp;Return to Ravnica: The Secretist<br>Bringing order from chaos—that is the mission of the Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble, transforming Ravnica into a field of rubble where the Gruul and the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakdos_ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakdos_ggr" target="_self">Rakdos</a>&nbsp;do whatever they please. The Azorius carry this weighty responsibility with stoic pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investigation, and enforcement with steely determination.The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named Azor. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the Living Guildpact. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.<br>The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches, called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a capital). The capitals of the three columns form the Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, Supreme Judge&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#isperia_ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#isperia_ggr" target="_self">Isperia</a>, an ancient and wise sphinx.The&nbsp;Sova Column&nbsp;consists of judges and the extensive legal apparatus surrounding them. It is tasked with adjudicating and arbitrating the effects of the law. The column employs legal aides, pages, librarians, experts on precedent, advocates for the accused, public prosecutors, and judges.The&nbsp;Jelenn Column&nbsp;writes and enacts the laws of Ravnica, involving the efforts not just of the designated legislators but also a network of bureaucrats: aides, writers, researchers, lobbyists, clerks, and so on.The&nbsp;Lyev Column&nbsp;enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, and lawmages. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the work of managing surveillance and precognition. Most adventuring characters, by their nature and because of their capabilities, are associated with the active work of the Lyev Column rather than the behind-the-scenes activity of the other columns.The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of Ravnica and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.In the absence of the Living Guildpact, the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the guilds. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilization can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.<br>The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the Gruul Clans and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical shows of the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakdos_ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakdos_ggr" target="_self">Rakdos</a>&nbsp;(in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakdos_ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakdos_ggr" target="_self">Rakdos</a>&nbsp;performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances.

The Simic squad was rounded out by a host of mages clad in scale armor, and improbable hybrid fusions of scaled, finned, and shelled creatures.”— Doug Beyer,&nbsp;Return to Ravnica: The SecretistThe secrets of life are revealed in the laboratories of the Simic, and their research notes plumb and catalog nature's wonders. Their original mission was to oversee issues of public health, but the Simic came to believe that complete health—of individuals and of society as a whole—depends on the mutual adaptation of nature and civilization to one another. Thus, biological experimentation has always been among its primary concerns.Historically, the guild's approach to its mission has been one of incremental progress toward a utopian ideal of thriving biology, and it remains more aloof from politics than other guilds. Its fundamental mission remains unchanged by the current political instability, and the isolation of its laboratories protects most Simic guild members from immediate harm.Little is known about the combine's founder, except that this individual's first or family name was Simic.Vast sinkholes called zonots are the primary geographic divisions among the Simic. Each zonot pierces layer upon layer of crumbled city as it descends deep below the surface and connects to ancient, long-forgotten ocean waters. A zonot is a distinct Simic habitat with its own culture and ecosystem, as well as a leader called a Speaker. The Speakers of all nine zonots form the Speakers' Chamber, and they elect a Prime Speaker from among them to serve as the Simic guildmaster.&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#zegana_ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#zegana_ggr" target="_self">Zegana</a>, the current Prime Speaker, is the Speaker of Zonot One, which is located in a remote, sparsely inhabited part of Ravnica far from the political activity of the Tenth District.The Simic guildhall, Zameck, is located in Zonot Seven within Precinct Five of Ravnica's Tenth District. A huge chamber just below the street serves as the gathering place for all the Speakers, as well as a location where non-Simic visitors can meet with the Prime Speaker or other combine emissaries.Two philosophical principles, in tension with each other, combine to give the Simic Combine its unique approach to science and nature. In traditional Simic thought, these principles are called the Holdfast and the Upwelling.The Holdfast principle, named for the biological mechanism that keeps kelp and sponges anchored to the sea floor, advises members of the Simic Combine never to stray so far from nature that they become "adrift." It espouses the idea that nature left undisturbed will evolve toward adaptive traits and increased strength. Nature will flourish and grow, and every creature will find its proper niche in the ecosystem where it can thrive.The Upwelling principle, named for the phenomenon of nutrient-rich water rising to the ocean surface, advocates that the new and enlivened should replace the old and depleted in an unending cycle, bringing constant refreshment and renewal. This principle accounts for the combine's analytical bent and its emphasis on knowledge as a means of transformation. Learning the secrets of the universe lets you shape the world as you desire. The Upwelling encourages every creature to discover its full potential.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/img/book/GGR/058-243.webp" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" title="Art credit: Willian Murai" href="https://5e.tools/img/book/GGR/058-243.webp" target="_self"></a><img src="https://5e.tools/img/book/GGR/058-243.webp" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">&nbsp;Willian MuraiThe Holdfast encourages the Simic to promote nature; the Upwelling urges them to perfect nature. The end result is the same: a hastened system of evolution that brings out the best in every creature's nature. But different factions within the Simic Combine interpret these principles in their own ways.<br>The leadership of the Simic Combine represents the traditional philosophy of the Utopians. Their vision is of an ideal world in which nature and civilization exist in balance, in which natural life adapts to life in the midst of modern civilization and the civilized world adapts to accommodate these creatures. Utopians generally interpret the Holdfast principle as being about staying rooted in nature, and the Upwelling as concerned with slow, predictable, cyclical improvement. So they remain hidden in their subaquatic laboratories, pursuing their research while isolated from the volatile interrelationships among the other guilds. Prime Speaker&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#zegana_ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#zegana_ggr" target="_self">Zegana</a>&nbsp;encourages that isolationist attitude.At the same time, a growing faction within the Simic believes that an all-out war among the guilds is inevitable, given the growing unrest in the city. These members, the Adaptationists, believe that the guilds exist in a fragile ecosystem in which the slightest imbalance can have cascading effects. With an absent Living Guildpact failing to maintain the balance, only catastrophe can result. The Simic must change in order to survive, and slow, small steps in pursuit of an ideal vision aren't enough. The future of the guild is in imminent danger, and the Simic need to focus on survival. Adaptationists tend to interpret the Holdfast as being about defense and security, and the Upwelling as a call for sudden, disruptive growth.As befits members of a guild of scientists, the Adaptationists' preparations for war include the creation of soldiers that are magically and biologically adapted. The Guardian Project has yielded hybrids that combine human, elf, or vedalken stock with the characteristics of crabs, fish, jellyfish, and a variety of other creatures to give them natural armor and weapons, gills, venomous stings, and other combat-focused adaptations.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr,2,simic%20combine" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr,2,simic%20combine" target="_self">Source</a>]]></description><link>guilds/simic-combine.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Guilds/Simic Combine.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:36:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://5e.tools/img/book/GGR/058-243.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://5e.tools/img/book/GGR/058-243.webp"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guild Primer]]></title><description><![CDATA[The ten guilds are the lifeblood of <a data-href="Ravnica" href="ravnica.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ravnica</a>, making up the foundation of its society. They are voluntary associations led by guild masters, but that's the extent of their resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found on most Dungeons &amp; Dragons worlds.

<br>Two widely divergent groups devoted to nature, the <a data-href="Golgari Swarm" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Golgari Swarm</a> and the <a data-href="Selesnya Conclave" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selesnya Conclave</a>
Citizens of Ravnica aren't born into guilds. An individual can choose to belong to any guild—or no guild. Some guilds, such as Selesnya and Boros, actively recruit new members, while others simply accept those who seek membership. People within a family might join different guilds, which can lead to strong connections between the guilds in question or to painful animosity in families whose members follow different paths.Even though citizens can choose their guild associations, long-standing traditions steer certain individuals toward a particular guild. For example, it would be highly unusual for a Devkarin elf (a dark elf) to join any guild other than the Golgari, and the Ordruun line of minotaurs has provided the Boros armies with generations of offspring. Members of certain races are also drawn to specific guilds, as noted in the description of each of guild.You establish your character's membership in a guild by choosing that guild's background from among those detailed in this chapter. This book assumes that you have chosen a guild and that you maintain your association with it throughout your life. As a result, your choice of guild can play a more significant role than most backgrounds do in shaping what your character does now, not just what you accomplished in the past.<br>The backgrounds associated with guilds in this chapter work like those in the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/book.html#phb" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/book.html#phb" target="_self">Player's Handbook</a>, giving you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws). Each guild entry also provides personal contacts; suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a member of a spell casting class.The spellcasters of Ravnica's guilds have a style of magic specific to their guild. A guild's description includes a list of guild spells that epitomize the type of magic the guild favors. The Boros Legion, for example, tends to prefer using spells of fire magic and holy light, and its guild spell list reflects that emphasis.If you play a character who has the Spell casting or the Pact Magic class feature, your guild spells are added to the spell list for your class, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.As a benefit of your guild membership, you have contacts both inside and outside the guild. Contacts are useful resources in the urban environment of Ravnica, where a friendly face can be more valuable than gold.<br>As stated in the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/book.html#phb" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/book.html#phb" target="_self">Player's Handbook</a>, bonds represent your connections to people, places, and events in the world. Contacts are people you have a connection to, but they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in comparison, are simply people you know. They might be friends, rivals, or even family members, but their relationship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.Although the tables of contacts in this chapter describe non player characters who are members of guilds (your own and others), you are likely to acquire guild-less contacts as well. NPCs such as goblin gang leaders, minotaur bartenders, and vedalken tailors all go about their lives in the shadow of the guilds but divorced from those groups' intrigue and politics.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr,2" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr,2" target="_self">Source</a>]]></description><link>guilds/guild-primer.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Guilds/Guild Primer.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:25:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[index]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome to the lore for Fey of Ravnica!Here is a set of quick links for you to peruse.<a data-href="Character Creation" href="character-creation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Creation</a><br>

Player Characters may belong to any guild (no renown) or be guild-less. All Player Characters are fresh recruits to the newly formed Ravnica Expedition Corp (no renown). While this story is set on Ravnica players are not allowed to play as a planeswalker. The reason for this is simple planeswalkers are really hard to balance D&amp;D around. If you want to play a planeswalker may I introduce you to a sister game of D&amp;D called Magic the Gathering where the tagline for over a decade has been "You are a Planeswalker!" If you are dead set on playing as one talk to the DM to home-brew a transformation. <br>Player Characters may be of any race and class in the <a data-href="Approved Material" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Approved Material</a> if you wish to play something outside of that seek DM approval. This is one of the most high fantasy campaigns imaginable. Your race will probably be approved, classes from other sources including home-brew are probably fine but the DM reserves the right to re-balance with the player as needed. This campaign uses a modified set of rules for Character creation: Origin feats may be replaced with any feat that the character meets the requirements for IF AND ONLY IF the character is created above level one. <br>
Everyone is allowed a <a data-href="Signature Magical Item" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Signature Magical Item</a>. Starting magical items are restricted to uncommon items that DO NOT have +1, +2, or +3 in their descriptions. If you want to select the endgame version of the magic item you want the DM will work with you to home-brew a starting version. <br>
If you would like to have an innate boon instead of a Signature Magical Item look over <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/charcreationoptions.html#anvilwrought_mot,fbmt:sand~b1~b0~b0,flstfeature%20type:supernatural%20gift=1,flopfeature%20type:extend" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/charcreationoptions.html#anvilwrought_mot,fbmt:sand~b1~b0~b0,flstfeature%20type:supernatural%20gift=1,flopfeature%20type:extend" target="_self">Supernatural Gifts.</a> Just like your Signature Magical Item these Gifts can evolve with you over time. Work with the dungeon master to create what you want. <br>
You may use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/statgen.html#pointbuy" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/statgen.html#pointbuy" target="_self">Point Buy</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/statgen.html#array" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/statgen.html#array" target="_self">Standard Array</a>, or a variant on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://statroller.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://statroller.com/" target="_self">4d6dl1</a> for generating Ability Scores. The variant rule for 4d6dl1 is easy for each die you roll you may use the dice as rolled or 3 players choice. This caps the lower bound of each stat to 9. Unless you specifically want to role play with lower stats. Players are allowed, and encouraged, to have and play as multiple characters. This used to be very normal although it has fallen out of favor with most 5e players. For the first few sessions I will be limiting you to playing one character at a time to streamline play. After that I will open this up for you. Multiple characters allows for a lot more interesting play options at the table. Suddenly things like splitting the party aren't nearly as big of an issue. The DM can always scale the difficultly of encounters when the party splits so the real reason that parties are told to avoid it is that its boring for Players when they are off screen for an extended period, having multiple character fixes this because you just send one of your characters with each group. As a Player you also dramatically expand your options in the story. Barbarians are great super fun, definitely in the top 15 of available classes, but they can start to feel pointless when there is nothing to rage at and smash. Bard's are great in social situations and you can make them great in combat but outside of combat is where they shine. If you are playing both of them at the same time you actually get to min-max without min-maxing. Instead of focusing on how do I make this character the best I can for their mechanical role in the party, you get to relax a little and do stupid things like put all your points into strength on the barbarian because you know the bard is going to send a lot of heals your way in combat. And then out of combat you still can have more dynamic engagement with the plot than "Grok hit tiny man?" which you know is hysterical for at least the first 1,000 times you say it but eventually it gets overplayed. If the thought of running two full blown characters sounds like way too much to handle, I get it. It really can be a lot to think about at the table. But you can do it I know you can because the DM does it with many characters every session. If you are still intimidated remember that you are encouraged but not required to have multiple characters. <br>Also last thought on the matter <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/classes.html#expert%20sidekick_tce,fbmt:sand~b0~b0~b0,flstsource:tce=1~erlw=1~efa=1~phb=1~scag=1~xge=1~bgg=1~xphb=1~mot=1~vrgr=1~frhof=1~dmg=1~psa=1~ggr=1~egw=1~ftd=1~uathemysticclass=1~psk=1~dsotdq=1~lordtob=1~humblewoodcampaignsetting=1~grimhollowpg24=1~humblewoodtales=1~pugilist2024=1~valdagunslinger=1,flstmiscellaneous:sidekick=1" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#expert%20sidekick_tce,fbmt:sand~b0~b0~b0,flstsource:tce=1~erlw=1~efa=1~phb=1~scag=1~xge=1~bgg=1~xphb=1~mot=1~vrgr=1~frhof=1~dmg=1~psa=1~ggr=1~egw=1~ftd=1~uathemysticclass=1~psk=1~dsotdq=1~lordtob=1~humblewoodcampaignsetting=1~grimhollowpg24=1~humblewoodtales=1~pugilist2024=1~valdagunslinger=1,flstmiscellaneous:sidekick=1" target="_self">SideKicks</a> exist. They are dramatically simplified characters which can make a good starting point to playing multiple characters. Some of the most fun I ever had was playing a Dark Elf Cleric with an int of 6 with a conman Aarakocra Expert Sidekick with a cha of 20 manipulating him. At least one of those characters shows up in this campaign :) Should the main character die and you wish to rework a sidekick into a main class that will be allowed.Players can expect to have access to true resurrection magic (for a price). So death is not necessarily the end of a character story. However the juice might not be worth the squeeze (I'm just putting this in writing so that no one thinks I'm changing the rules when I make access to this really hard). <br>Not strictly required but <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/book.html#xphb,2" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/book.html#xphb,2" target="_self">RTFM</a>

Again for total creative freedom ... work with the DM to get your overpowered furry OC home-brew approved.
Roll some mother fucking dice! Also known as Get your Ability Scores. Generate your abilities scores with any method mentioned above. Rolls must be made in front of the DM. There is a secret 4th option from older editions no one talks about any more. It's roll 1d20 per score. I'll let you choose this one if you want. But no grace rolls or taking averages. You are stuck with what you get. Technically 1d20 can let you start with a 19 or 20 in a stat where as the max elsewhere is 18 ... but statistically 4d6dl1 is the best and my variant on it only makes it better.
Pick an Alignment. This is a stupid and outdated set of mechanics. Our first two steps replace this.
Work with the DM to get your backstory approved. This is the most important part of making your Character come to life in the world. You know who you want to play from the first two steps. Now you work with the DM to integrate them into the larger story. After this step you should no longer be your character's biggest fan. The game is more fun when you make the DM the biggest fan of your character. When the DM roots for the party to win you get away with more dope shit at the table.
Select your Signature Magic Item with DM approval. MATH TIME!!! WOOOOO!!!! It kinda sucks ... but its really not that hard its mostly just adding a few single digit numbers together. The DM will show you the easy way to copy everything else you need on your character sheet without having to write it down. But the numbers are important for you to get familiar with so you have to copy those yourself.
Have a snack! Grab a drink! Get one of each for you DM! Enjoy watching your fellow party members come to life in a similar way.

If you have lived here for a while forgive me but we have a lot of newcomers these days so let me start by setting the scene. Here on Ravnica we expanded our glorious city until it covered the entire world! As you can imagine having a world spanning city means there's a lot of different ideas and peoples that all have to live together here on Ravnica. You can thank the guild pact for keeping the peace here. Once upon a time we didn't have one and the whole world was in chaos. But that was over 10,000 years ago! More recently we didn't have one again but through some magic that's a bit over my head the guild pact was restored now as a mortal man named Jace Beleren. With peace restored at least while Jace was on Ravnica the city returned to its normal state for the last 20 years or so. Then we were invaded by fucking blue alien zombie hippos pulling chariots for blue fucking alien zombies!!! The history books have taken to calling that event the war of the spark. We lost many Ravnicans during those dark days. The entire plane was a war zone, and when a Ravnican died they just got raised as a zombie to help the invaders. Eventually with the help of many Planeswalkers, who were temporarily trapped here, Niv-Mizzet awoke as the avatar of the plane, the new living guild pact, a dragon, and a god. With this newfound power the invaders were defeated. With the average Ravnican now aware that our world is simply one of many in an infinite cosmos there was a public outcry to learn more about other worlds.It's been 5 years since the war of the spark ended. And we are proud to announce that at long last the Ravnica Expedition Corp is opening general recruitment! We have been sending Ravnicans out into the multiverse since the war of the spark to recruit powerful allies and learn all about the various cultures of the other planes! But now we have perfected the very technology that was once our ruin the Planar Bridge is now the Planar Gate. Before it could only move non-living matter across planar boundaries, but now that the fire mind has had an opportunity to study it, and enough goblins have been tossed in as experiments. We can confidently say that it is a safe and effective way to travel. The Ravnica Expedition Corp is special joint venture between all the guilds under the direct control of Niv-Mizzet himself. Join us here at the Ravnica Expedition Corp and see the worlds! Do you have what it takes to become one of Ravnica's best?]]></description><link>setting-details.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Setting details.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 14:32:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ravnica]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you want to know way more about Ravnica than you need to read <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ggr" target="_self">this.</a> If you keep reading that whole book you'll know more than the DM does.]]></description><link>ravnica.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ravnica.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 20:26:34 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
